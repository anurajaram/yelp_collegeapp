<h2>College Search App using Yelp API</h2>

Shiny app built on top of Yelp API. <br>
Input pane on left takes 2 user inputs: <br>
<ol>
<li>Location - either as city name or zipcode. Spaces not allowed! </li>
<li>Search radius in miles </li>
</ol><br><br>

Output pane on right has 3 tabs: <br>
<ul>
<li>"Tab1" - Display user selections again.</li>
<li>"Plot" - map view of colleges clustered in the area</li>
<li>"Table" - tabular view of college names, number of reviews and overall Yelp rating. </li>
</ul>
Output is filtered to show only colleges with 3+ reviews, hence some names may be missing.<br><br>
